# Terms and Conditions

**Last updated: February 24, 2026**

By downloading or using ReadFirst, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.

## Use of the App

ReadFirst is an iOS app that helps you earn screen time by reading articles. The app uses Apple's Screen Time API (FamilyControls) to manage app access on your device.

## Screen Time and FamilyControls

ReadFirst relies on Apple's FamilyControls framework to restrict and grant access to apps. By using ReadFirst, you grant the app permission to manage app restrictions on your device through this framework. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings.

## Content

ReadFirst does not provide, host, or control the articles you read. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or availability of any third-party material accessed through the app.

## Disclaimer

ReadFirst is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that it will meet your specific requirements.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
